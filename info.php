    <h2>How to Play Clock Clicker Game</h2>

    <p>Welcome to the Clock Clicker Game! The objective of this game is to click on the clock as many times as you can, earning points based on your click speed and accuracy. Hereâ€™s how it works:</p>

    <h3>Gameplay Basics:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Multiplier:</strong> Each second that passes increases the multiplier for subsequent clicks. The multiplier starts at 1x.</li>
        <li><strong>Total Time:</strong> This is the total time accumulated from all your clicks, multiplied by the current multiplier.</li>
        <li><strong>Best Time:</strong> Your highest Total Time achieved in a single game session.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Play:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Click on the clock as many times as you can within each second.</li>
        <li>The multiplier increases with time, so aim for quick consecutive clicks during the same second to maximize your score.</li>
        <li>Your Total Time is displayed after each click, reflecting the accumulated score based on the current multiplier.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Scoring:</h3>
    <p>Each click adds a fixed amount of time (1 second) multiplied by the current multiplier to your Total Time. The game tracks and displays your Best Time across all sessions.</p>

    <h3>Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rapid Clicks:</strong> Try to click as quickly as possible within each second to maximize the multiplier effect.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistent Play:</strong> Keep your clicks consistent and avoid delays between them to maintain a high multiplier.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Management:</</strong> Use your understanding of how the multiplier increases to plan your clicking strategy effectively.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Enjoy the game and try to beat your Best Time!</p>
